				<h2>Oxfam Online Sales</h2>
				<p>My main role within the company is to increase online sales. The daily activities include quality checking, selecting and displaying suitable donated items on Oxfam's online shop. To maximise profit and sales my team and I use different pricing techniques such as psychological, product bundle and value pricings as well as monitor the progress of sales online.

				<h2>Castle School Volunteer</h2>
				<p>I volunteered at The Castle School with children facing mental and physical challenges and having special educational needs. The main responsibility was communicating as it was essential to find the right approaches to each and every child in the class, guide them through their classwork carefully and enthusiastically and get involved with them in a variety of activities.</p>
